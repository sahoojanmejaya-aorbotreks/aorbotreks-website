        <h4>Platform Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>Aorbo Treks is a digital technology platform that facilitates the discovery, comparison, and booking of
            trekking,
            travel, and adventure tourism services offered by independent third-party Vendors. Aorbo Treks does
            <strong>not own,
                operate, manage, or control</strong> any treks, tours, or travel services listed on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>All service-related information displayed on the platform—such as pricing, availability, itineraries, or
            inclusions—is provided and managed solely by the respective Vendors. Bookings made through the platform
            establish a <strong>direct contractual relationship between the User and the Vendor</strong>. Aorbo Treks is
            not a party to that
            agreement and bears no responsibility for its execution or fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>Aorbo Treks expressly disclaims all warranties, express or implied, regarding the <strong>accuracy,
                reliability, quality,
                legality, safety, or fitness</strong> of any services offered by Vendors. Users are advised to exercise
            due diligence
            before booking. Aorbo Treks shall not be held liable for any loss, damage, cancellation, or injury resulting
            from Vendor-provided services</p>

        <h3 class="h4 fw-semibold" id="booking-payment">4. Booking and Payment Terms</h3>
        <h4>Booking Process:</h4>
        <p> Users may browse, select, and initiate bookings for treks and related services through the Aorbo Treks
            Platform.
            All bookings are subject to availability and the individual terms and conditions established by the
            respective
            Vendor. By completing a booking, the User enters into a direct agreement with the selected Vendor, not with
            Aorbo Treks.</p>
        <h4>Payment Modes:</h4>
        <p> Aorbo Treks facilitates various payment methods for the User’s convenience, depending on the Vendor’s listed
            terms. These may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>1.Full Payment:</h4>
                <p> The User pays the total trip amount in advance via the Platform. Aorbo Treks collects and disburses
                    the
                    amount to the respective Vendor in accordance with internal settlement timelines.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>2.Partial Payment:</h4>
                <p>The User pays a non-refundable booking fee through the Platform, with the remaining balance payable
                    directly to the Vendor via the payment method and timeline agreed upon at the time of booking.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>3.Pay at Site:</h4>
                <p>The User pays a defined portion through the Platform and agrees to settle the remaining balance in
                    person—by cash, UPI, or card—at the designated trek start point. Aorbo Treks does not assume
                    responsibility for any disputes arising from in-person payments made directly to the Vendor.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Liability Disclaimer:</h4>
        <p> Aorbo Treks acts solely as an intermediary in the booking and payment process. We are not responsible for
            pricing discrepancies, payment failures, refusal of service by Vendors, or any other transaction-related
            disputes between Users and Vendors. Users are advised to retain proof of payment and confirm payment details
            directly with the Vendor prior to travel.</p>
        <h4>Additional Charges Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>The User acknowledges and agrees that certain charges may not be included in the base trek booking amount
            displayed on the Aorbo Treks platform. These additional charges may include, but are not limited to, toll
            fees,
            parking charges, permit fees, government levies, gear rentals, or porter services.</p>
        <p>Such charges shall be borne solely by the User and are payable directly to the respective Vendor, trek
            organizer,
            or their authorized representatives. Aorbo Treks acts solely as a booking intermediary and shall not be held
            liable for the disclosure, accuracy, or settlement of these third-party costs.</p>
        <p>Vendors or organizers are responsible for informing Users of any applicable additional charges, either at the
            time of booking, during pre-departure communication, or on-ground during the trek. Users are advised to
            confirm
            such potential costs with the organizer prior to the commencement of the trek.</p>
        <p><strong>Refund Responsibility Disclaimer:</strong> Aorbo Treks shall not be held liable for processing or
            determining the
            eligibility or quantum of refunds. All refund-related requests are governed solely by the respective
            Vendor’s
            cancellation and refund policy. The decision to approve, deny, or calculate the refund amount rests entirely
            with the Vendor. Aorbo Treks shall, however, provide reasonable assistance in facilitating communication and
            coordination between the User and the Vendor.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment Security:</strong> All transactions are securely processed through third-party payment
            gateways. Aorbo Treks does
            not store any sensitive financial information.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Service Charges:</strong> A facilitation fee may be charged by Aorbo Treks and will be clearly
            disclosed at the time of
            booking.</p>
        <p><strong>Taxes:</strong> Users are responsible for the payment of all applicable taxes in accordance with
            local laws.</p>
